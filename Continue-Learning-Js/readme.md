# CSV-to-JSON
* Problem - Convert CSV file to json

## Features 
* Functional programming
* Chaining Methods
* ES6 Fat Arrow 
* Practice using Array.prototype.reduce 

***
# Explorer.js
Make a modular Library that Constructs objects and lets instances inherit properties and methods. This library creates Explorer objects with coordinates. You can call methods on each object/person allowing them to move North, East, South, and West

## Features 
* OOP - Object Orient Programming
* Function constructor 
* Prototypical inheritance
* Method Chaining and Functional Programing 
* Wrapping Library in a IFFE and not polluting namespace
* Modularity able to use with Node or on the Browser
* Some Error handlers

# Functional Library 
This was meant to create a modular library to modify strings not objects. So I stood away from OOP. 

## Features 
* Functional Programing 
* Modular Style - Its reusable in other environments and does not clutter namespace
* Uses Function.prototype.call
* Uses Array.prototype.reduce

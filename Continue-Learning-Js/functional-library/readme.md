# Functional Library 
This was meant to create a modular library to modify strings not objects. So I stood away from OOP. 

## Features 
* Functional Programing 
* Modular Style - Its reusable in other environments and does not clutter namespace
* Uses Function.prototype.call
* Uses Array.prototype.reduce

# Functional Library 
This was meant to create a modular librar to modify string not objects. So I stood away from OOP. 

## Features 
* Funtional Programing
* Modular Style - Its reuasble in other inviorements and does not clutter namespace
* Uses Function.prototype.call
* Uses Array.prototype.reduce
